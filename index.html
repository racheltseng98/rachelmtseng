            Over Winter Break 2019, a group of 10 from Sheil pioneered a service trip to the Mexican border in Arizona.
            We listened, prayed, and helped organizations that were dedicated to helping asylum seekers in whatever way we could. 
            We also had the opportunity to witness a naturalization ceremony. One of the biggest takeaways
            that I hold dear to my heart is: <span class= 'quote'> 'Being Present Is The Most Powerful Expression Of Love.' </span>

                            I was inspired to start this blog during Spring Break 2020. As Spring Break was 2 weeks long, I engaged in other activities such as knitting and baking. I wanted to keep all the photos and my thoughts together and therefore decided to create a blog. Journaling 
                            has always been advertised as an effective stress-relieving method. Having a blog would not only hold me accountable for it, but would also provide an avenue in which I am able to look back fondly on all the memories made.
